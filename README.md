# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

##Course Project

The RunAnalysis.R does the following: 
<br/>1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
<br/>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
<br/>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
<br/>4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
<br/>5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
